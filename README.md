`Create Socket App` is similar to React's `Create React App`.  
It will help you build native apps for mobile and desktop with Svelte, Reactjs, Vuejs and others!  
The idea is to provide a few basic boilerplates and some strong opinions so you can get coding on a production quality app as quickly as possible.  

## Set up your Socket environement  

You can find more details about prerequisites, instructions, and many useful tips in [Socket Runtime](https://socketsupply.co/guides/) documentation.

## Output:

Now inside of your directory, you should have a `directory structure` like this:

```bash
.
├── README.md
├── build.js
├── package.json
├── socket.ini
├── src
│   ├── icon.png
│   ├── index.css
│   ├── index.html
│   └── index.js
└── test
    ├── index.js
    └── test-context.js
```
